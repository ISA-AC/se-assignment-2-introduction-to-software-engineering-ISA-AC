# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
This is an egineering approach that entails building softwares through designing, developments testing and maintenance.
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering is the systematic approach of solving life related problems using a structured approach while traditional programming entails building a solution without a formal followed procedure as long as the final product is achieved.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
This is the outline procedural way of developing a software which is arranged in six phases namely, Requirement specification, Design, Implementation, testing, Deployment and Maintenance.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Requirement specification - this is where the user need are gathered are gathered and documented so that the developer will know the problem to be solving.
Design- creating the models and designs according to the problem to be solved
Implementation- this is the process of writing the codes according to the specifications to build the software.
Testing- this is the process of checking whether the software works and has met the user needs.
Deployment- this is the release of the software to the user for actual activity it was made for.
Maintenance- this is the continous support offered for softwares  with updates.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
For waterfall model it involves systematic building of the software, from one stage to another sequentially while Agile is iterative and the the process is not sequential as there may be different collaborations in handling a problem

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile is an incremental approach focused on flexibility while Waterfall is sequential. in agile there is no particular order for the stages while waterfall the sequence must be kept.
Agile is used for long term benefits as compared to waterfall due to it's flexibility. 
Requirements Engineering:
Requirements gathering, specification, documenting.
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
This is the discipline that involves gathering,documenting user needs and specifications and also ensuring the needs are adhered to during development.
- Feasibility study- identifying the underlying problem
- User needs familiarization- reading and gettin gto know the needs to solve the issue.
- Requirements specification- spesifying what is require dto solve the issue
- Verification and validation- authenticating and agreeing that what is collected is what is needed for the sytem.
-Requirements management- ensuring that the requirements specified are met during the development.
This ensures that the software will be in the position to handle the originally intended purpose.
Software Design Principles:
 a process to plan or convert the software requirements into a step that are needed to be carried out to develop a software system

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
The software is divided into various components that work together to form a single functioning item but sometimes they can perform as a complete function if not connected with each other.
It helps when one area is hit by a problem it might not affect the whole software and as well can be maintained individually. it is also possible to build on an existing software for better functioning
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit testing- individual componets are checked on their operations.
Integration testing- where the software is checked on compatibility with other components.
System testing is the evaluation of the whole system.
Acceptance testing is where the software is checked as to whether it meets the user needs and requirements.
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
These are systems that help to track and manage changes to a software code. They help to reduce errors by backtracking small changes made and also provide a good platform for collaboration
Some include Git, Github, Helix core
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
This person is responsible for project planning for sotware development and also monitoring and controlling the progress of the forsaid planned project. They are responsible for cost estimates, risk management and staffing
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
This is the process of checking, modifying and providing the necessary updates for the best running of the software.
Maintenance is essential to keep it secure, reliable to the users and effective in the purpose.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
Respect to user Privacy and data security- every software should be structured to keep personal data safe.


What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Some ethical issues involve privacy, accuracy, accessibily and the effects on life by being honest, respecting privacy, ensuring accessibility and inclusivity
